## Introduction

The Pomodoro Timer is a time management method designed to boost productivity by breaking work into timed intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, called "pomodoros". After each pomodoro, you're rewarded with a short break, typically 5 minutes.

This application provides a user-friendly interface to practice the Pomodoro Technique, helping users to accomplish tasks more efficiently.

## Features

- Start a new pomodoro timer.
- Automatically transition to a break after a pomodoro.
- Pause and continue functionality.
- Option to start a new cycle or return to the main screen after a break.

## How to Use

1. Choose your task (e.g., "Coding", "Working", or "Studying").
2. Click on the task button to start the timer.
3. After 25 minutes of work, the app will automatically transition to a 5-minute break.
4. Once the break is over, you can choose to start another pomodoro or return to the main screen.
